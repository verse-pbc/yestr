# NDK Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the social features (following and reactions) in the Yestr app to use NDK (Nostr Development Kit) while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Services Created

#### `follow_service_ndk.dart`
- Implements the same interface as the original `FollowService`
- Uses NDK's `follows` API for contact list management
- Features:
  - Follow/unfollow users
  - Get following list
  - Get followers list
  - Get mutual follows
  - Real-time contact list updates via subscription
  - Local caching for offline access

#### `reaction_service_ndk.dart`
- Implements reactions (likes, reposts) using NDK
- Features:
  - Like posts (kind 7 events)
  - Unlike posts (via deletion events)
  - Repost notes (kind 6 events)
  - Get reactions for events
  - Check if user has liked an event
  - Real-time reaction updates

### 2. Migration Helper

#### `service_migration_helper.dart`
- Manages the switch between old and new services
- Allows for easy rollback if needed
- Provides methods to:
  - Initialize NDK
  - Enable/disable NDK services
  - Get the appropriate service instance based on configuration

### 3. Updated Components

#### `main.dart`
- Added NDK initialization at app startup
- Falls back to legacy services if NDK fails to initialize

#### Screen Updates
- `card_overlay_screen.dart` - Uses migration helper to get services
- `profile_screen.dart` - Uses migration helper to get services
- No changes to UI or functionality from user perspective

### 4. NDK Adapter Updates

#### `follow_adapter.dart`
- Fixed API calls to match NDK 0.4.0:
  - Use `broadcastAddContact()` instead of custom contact list building
  - Use `broadcastRemoveContact()` for unfollowing
  - Use `ContactList.kKind` instead of `ContactList.KIND`
  - Use `pubKey` property instead of `pubkey`

#### `ndk_service.dart`
- Fixed authentication methods:
  - Use `loginPrivateKey()` instead of `setActiveSigner()`
  - Use `isLoggedIn` property instead of `hasSigner`
  - Use `logout()` instead of `removeSigner()`

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. Test following functionality:
   - Follow a user by swiping right
   - Check that follow events are published to relays
   - Verify contact list persists across app restarts
3. Test reaction functionality:
   - Like posts in profile view
   - Verify reactions are published to relays
   - Check that liked state persists
4. Verify profile discovery continues working

### Integration Test
Run the manual integration test:
```bash
dart test_ndk_integration.dart
```

## Benefits of NDK Migration

1. **Robustness**: NDK handles relay management, reconnections, and error handling
2. **Performance**: Uses JIT engine for optimal relay selection (outbox model)
3. **Consistency**: Follows Nostr best practices and NIPs
4. **Maintainability**: Less custom code to maintain
5. **Features**: Easy access to advanced features like gossip model, relay sets, etc.

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered, you can easily rollback:

1. In `main.dart`, comment out NDK initialization:
```dart
// await ServiceMigrationHelper.enableNdkServices();
ServiceMigrationHelper.disableNdkServices();
```

2. The app will automatically use the legacy services

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the app for any issues with the new NDK-based services
2. Consider migrating other services (ProfileService, DirectMessageService) to NDK
3. Implement additional features like:
   - Zaps (Lightning tips)
   - Better relay management
   - Gossip model for improved content discovery
   - NIP-65 relay lists

## Known Limitations

- The Rust verifier doesn't work in test environment (this is expected)
- Full NDK migration would require updating all services, not just social features
