# Direct Message Conversation Fix

## Issue
Conversations appeared empty in the conversation view even though they showed message previews in the Messages screen.

## Root Cause
Each screen was creating its own instance of `DirectMessageService`, which meant that messages loaded in the Messages screen were not available in the Conversation screen because they were using different service instances with separate message storage.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **DirectMessageService Singleton Pattern**
- Converted `DirectMessageService` to use a singleton pattern
- Added factory constructor that returns the same instance
- Added `resetInstance()` method for cleanup on logout
- This ensures all screens share the same message data

### 2. **Enhanced Message Loading in ConversationScreen**
- Added fallback to load messages from cache if not in memory
- Added automatic retry to load from relays if no messages found
- Added detailed logging to track message loading process
- Improved user experience by showing cached messages immediately

### 3. **Improved getMessagesForPubkey Method**
- Enhanced to automatically fetch messages from relays if none in memory
- Added specific subscriptions for the conversation being viewed
- Added delay to allow messages to be processed before returning

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Logging**
- Added logging throughout the message handling pipeline
- Tracks when messages are received, decrypted, and stored
- Helps debug issues with message loading and display

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the Messages screen and wait for conversations to load
2. Click on a conversation that shows a message preview
3. The conversation should now display all messages correctly
4. New messages should appear in real-time in both screens

## Additional Improvements
- Messages are now loaded from cache first for instant display
- If no cached messages, the system automatically fetches from relays
- Better error handling and user feedback during loading
